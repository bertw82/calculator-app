 Calculator app challenge from Frontend Mentor

In this challenge I created a functional calculator using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The calculator has three different colors schemes that a user can toggle between. This calculator functions like any simple calculator that you can find and the functionality was created with JavaScript.
